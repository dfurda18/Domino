# Domino
A multiplayer domino game. Up to four players can play at a time. The server would wait until all players are ready. It can also be hard-coded to reduce the number of playable character and it creates two players controlled by a simple AI. The players play in teams of two according to the latin rules of dominoes. Once a team wins, the client must be restarted.
